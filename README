== PayPal Ruby SDK - Extended ==

This is an extension of the Ruby SDK provided by PayPal.  The intention is to 
make some of the function calls a little more object oriented, and a little
less hash based.

This will also be packaged as a gem instead of a Rails plugin (buried inside
a Rails project...)
