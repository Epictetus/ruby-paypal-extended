== PayPal Ruby SDK - Extended ==

This is an extension of the Ruby SDK provided by PayPal.  The intention is to 
make some of the function calls a little more object oriented, and a little
less hash based.

This will also be packaged as a gem instead of a Rails plugin (buried inside
a Rails project...)

== Testing ==
There is minimal testing of the basic API functionality, because it came
pre-written from PayPal, and I'm going to assume that PayPal put it together
correctly.

For new code (and refactoring) there are tests in the /test directory.  To run
them, use rake:
rake test
